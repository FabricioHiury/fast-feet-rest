# FastFeet — Delivery Management API

FastFeet is a fictional carrier service designed to manage the full lifecycle of deliveries, from order creation and courier assignment to final delivery confirmation. This API is built with a **domain-driven approach** following **clean architecture principles** to ensure maintainability, scalability, and separation of concerns.

## Overview

FastFeet provides a structured system for managing deliveries, couriers, and recipients while enforcing key business rules to maintain order integrity. The API is modular and divided into the following **core subdomains**:

- **Delivery**: Manages orders, couriers, and recipients, including delivery statuses and order tracking.
- **User**: Handles user authentication, authorization, and role-based access control (`admin` and `courier`).
- **Notification**: Sends real-time notifications to recipients whenever an order’s status changes.

By implementing a **clean architecture**, the API separates **domain logic** from **infrastructure and framework-specific code**, making it easy to test and extend.

## Features

- **User Management**
  - Authentication via CPF and password
  - Role-based access control (`admin` and `courier`)
  - Secure password management and permission enforcement

- **Delivery Management**
  - Full CRUD operations for couriers, orders, and recipients
  - Order lifecycle tracking (waiting, picked up, delivered, returned)
  - Ensures only the assigned courier can mark an order as delivered

- **Notifications**
  - Automated notifications to recipients when order statuses change

- **Architecture & Scalability**
  - Modular, clean architecture with separation of concerns
  - Easy to maintain and extend

## Project Structure

1. **`src/core`**
   - Contains the fundamental elements of the domain, independent of frameworks or infrastructure.
   - Subdirectories:
     - **`entities`**: Represents the main domain entities (e.g., `Order`, `Courier`, `Recipient`).
     - **`errors`**: Defines custom domain-specific errors.
     - **`events`**: Manages domain events (e.g., "OrderStatusChanged").
     - **`repositories`**: Abstract interfaces for data repositories.
     - **`services`**: Centralizes business logic here.
     - **`shared`**: Components or utilities shared across modules.
     - **`types`**: TypeScript-specific types for the domain.
     - **`either.ts` and `either.spec.ts`**: Implementation and tests for types like `Either` (used for error handling).

2. **`src/domain`**
   - Divided into main subdomains:
     - **`delivery`**: Manages the entire lifecycle of deliveries.
     - **`notification`**: Handles notifications for recipients.
     - **`user`**: Manages authentication, authorization, and users.

3. **`test`**
   - Contains unit and integration tests.

4. **Configuration Files**
   - **`.eslintrc.json`**: ESLint configuration for code linting.
   - **`.gitignore`**: Defines which files/directories should be ignored by Git.
   - **`package.json`**: Project metadata and dependencies.
   - **`pnpm-lock.yaml`**: Lockfile generated by PNPM to ensure consistency in dependencies.
   - **`README.md`**: Main project documentation.
   - **`tsconfig.json`**: TypeScript configuration.
   - **`vite.config.mts`**: Vite configuration.
